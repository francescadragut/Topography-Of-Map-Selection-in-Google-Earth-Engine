# Topography-Of-Map-Selection-in-Google-Earth-Engine

USER GUIDE
Link to the application: https://francescadragut01.users.earthengine.app/view/topography-of-map-selection  

At the moment of opening, there are more options for the user. At the top of the screen, there is a search bar, which can be used for searching specific places. This can be used or, otherwise, the user can move the map with the mouse or the pad. Also, in the top-left part of the screen, there are the Google Earth Engine built-in functions to zoom-in and zoom-out, which can be used. In the bottom-left corner, there is the control panel, which enables the user to select either a rectangle or a polygon. 
 
When pressing „Select Rectangle” or „Select Polygon” button, the cursor will transform into the shape of a cross, to indicate that the user can start the selection.
 
How the application looks like after the results are rendered:
In the bottom-right corner of the screen, there appears a panel with the elevation data for the selected area. The first field contains the mean elevation data for the area. The second field contains the maximum elevation, which can be seen on the selection with a red dot. The third field contains the minimum elevation, which can be seen on the selection with a green dot.
 
The user can also zoom in and the details will be more visible.
Mention: the same applies to selecting a polygon.
